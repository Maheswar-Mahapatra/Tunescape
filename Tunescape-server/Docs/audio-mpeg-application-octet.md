The main difference between the content types "audio/mpeg" and "application/octet" lies in their intended use and the way they are interpreted by clients.

audio/mpeg: This content type is specifically used for MPEG audio files, commonly referred to as MP3 files. It indicates that the content being served is an audio file encoded in the MPEG audio format. This content type is primarily associated with audio files and is commonly used for streaming or downloading audio content.

application/octet: This content type, also known as "binary data," is a generic and versatile MIME type. It is used for arbitrary binary data or files that do not fit into any specific content type category. "Octet" refers to a group of eight bits, which is the fundamental unit of data in computing. The "application/octet" content type is often used when the actual content type of a file is unknown or not easily categorized.

In terms of interpretation by clients and servers:

For "audio/mpeg," many audio players and streaming services are designed to recognize and handle this specific content type for MP3 files. It allows clients to understand that the content being served is an audio file and interpret it accordingly.
On the other hand, "application/octet" is a general-purpose content type. It does not provide any specific information about the content, and the interpretation of the data is left to the client application. It is often used as a fallback or default content type when the actual content type is unknown or when serving binary files that do not have a more specific content type.
In summary, "audio/mpeg" is used for MPEG audio files (such as MP3), indicating that the content is specifically an audio file, while "application/octet" is a generic content type used for arbitrary binary data or when the actual content type is unknown or irrelevant.
